## A Minimal Example of Literate Programming with R Markdown

We examined the relationship between artefact mass and distance from source using a linear regression model:
$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$.

```{r model, echo=FALSE}
# draw plot
plot(artefacts, pch = 20, col = 'darkgray')
#fit linear model
fit <- lm(`mass (g)` ~ `distance from source (km)`,  
               data = artefacts)
# draw linear model regression line on plot
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
# get slope value to use in text
slope <- round(coef(fit)[2],2)
```
The slope of a simple linear regression is `r slope`.
